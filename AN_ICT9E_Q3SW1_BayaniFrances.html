    	<h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    	<p>Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy, but secretly does experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension, "the Upside Down". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.</p>

      		<p>Eleven appears to have been born a psychic with notable telekinetic and extrasensory abilities. However, when she uses these abilities to a significant degree, she becomes temporarily weakened and her nose bleeds. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised as a test subject in Hawkins National Laboratory in order to develop her psychokinetic skills.</p>
      		<p>Eleven is a telekinetic girl who is the sole match for the creatures of the Upside Down. She later becomes Jim Hopper's adoptive daughter and Mike Wheeler's girlfriend.</p>

      		<p>At the beginning of the series, Mike is playing Dungeons & Dragons with his best friends, Dustin Henderson, Lucas Sinclair, and Will Byers on November 6, 1983. That night, Will mysteriously disappears. The next day, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas find a girl with a shaved head named Eleven. They take Eleven back to Mike's house and hide her in his basement. Later, Will's corpse is apparently found in a local quarry, but the boys are convinced that Will is alive and in a parallel dimension, which they call the “Upside Down”.</p>
      		<p>Michael "Mike" Wheeler is the son of Karen and Ted Wheeler, younger brother of Nancy and older brother of Holly, and is friends with Lucas, Dustin and Will. Mike is an intelligent and conscientious student who is committed to Lucas, Dustin and Will</p>

      		<p>Will, the younger brother of Jonathan Byers and the son of Joyce Byers and Lonnie Byers, is a shy, kind, and often timid boy. In the group's Dungeons and Dragons party, Will is the cleric, but later occasionally plays the role of Dungeon Master; he is referred to as "Will the Wise". In November 1983, he vanishes somewhere near "Mirkwood" after encountering a monster that escaped through a rift to the "Upside Down", an alternate dimension discovered by the Hawkins Laboratory scientists. Will begins communicating with Joyce through lightbulbs, so Joyce arranges a setup so Will can "talk" through the lights next to letters to create sentences. When Jim Hopper and Joyce venture into the Upside Down and find him unconscious, they revive him with CPR and bring him back to the real world, but he still has side effects from his time in the alternate dimension, including a slug emerging from his mouth and visions of the Upside Down.</p>

      		<p>Dustin Henderson is a friend of Mike, Will, and Lucas, and a goofy and quick-witted boy whose cleidocranial dysplasia causes him to lisp. In the Dungeons and Dragons party, Dustin is the Bard and has arguably the most extensive knowledge of the game, particularly the monsters. He has a crush on Nancy, and while both he and Lucas have feelings for Max in season two, Lucas and Max ultimately end up together. He also befriends Steve, who gives him advice on how to make girls like him.</p>
